**Note:**
With the main repo from Orbmu2k having gone without updates in over 2 yeras, this fork aims to collect changes made across various forks into a single release that represents the "most up to date version" possible. Changes are reviewed and manually merged from forks of the original nvidiaProfileInspector repo found on GitHub.

If you would like to contribute directly - or take over this project - please reach out! I am not a C# developer, just an enthusiast who knows enough to resolve merge conflicts.

**Original README body:**

![](/nspector/Images/n1-016.png) **NVIDIA Profile Inspector**

This tool is used for modifying game profiles inside the internal driver database of the nvidia driver.
All game profiles are provided by the nvidia driver, but you can add your own profiles for games missing in the driver database.
You also have access to hidden and undocumented settings, which are not provided by the drivers control panel.

For more information how to use this tool, you can find some very good wikis here:
